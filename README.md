The Impact of Information Disclosure Quality on Market Manipulation: A Study Based on Text Mining of MD&amp;A

**Abstract**ï¼š
China's financial market is rapidly evolving with reforms like the registration system and the T+0 trading system, fostering high-frequency trading. However, these changes escalate the risk of market manipulation. Therefore, a thorough examination of market manipulation behavior and the implementation of preventive measures are crucial. Scholars assert that lower annual report text quality correlates with opportunistic behavior and the risk of stock price collapse. While it is theorized that poor information disclosure quality worsens market manipulation, there is a lack of empirical evidence. This study addresses the gap by utilizing the readability of the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) in annual reports as a indicator to explore the relationship and mechanism between company information disclosure quality and market manipulation.
The research examines A-shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges from 2014 to 2022. By extracting MD&A text from annual reports, eight readability indicators are analyzed for length, logic, and difficulty. Correlations with disclosure quality scores serve as weights to create the disclosure readability index. The study employs a bidirectional fixed-effects model as the baseline regression model, conducting endogeneity tests using instrumental variable methods. Stability is also ensured through variable replacement tests. It validates the mediating role of analyst attention in the relationship between information disclosure quality and market manipulation, followed by heterogeneity analysis on institutional environment, corporate governance, technological application, and external supervision. The paper concludes with a summary and proposed policy recommendations finally.
Results show that high-quality information disclosure curbs market manipulation. Lower market capitalization, weaker profitability, higher stock trading activity, and greater institutional investor ownership correlate with increased manipulation risk. Poor information disclosure quality, by reducing analyst attention, increases the risk of market manipulation. Moreover, the impact of information disclosure on manipulation is more notable in state-owned enterprises, firms with blurred management function separation, limited digitalization, and suboptimal audit quality.
The study expands the exploration of factors influencing market manipulation by establishing a connection between information disclosure quality and manipulation. It challenges prior research by asserting that inadequate information disclosure reduces analyst attention. The study introduces an Information Disclosure Readability Index, capturing the influence of text features on disclosure quality. This research is not only significant for investment decisions, market supervision, and corporate governance but also broadens the academic perspective on the relationship between information disclosure and market manipulation, providing a reference for future studies.
